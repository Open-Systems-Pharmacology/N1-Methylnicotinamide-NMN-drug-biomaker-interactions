## N1-Methylnicotinamide (NMN) drug-biomaker interactions
Modeling of clinical NMN drug-biomarker interaction studies with trimethoprim and pyrimethamine for model evaluation

### Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute MoBi project files containing simulations of clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the NMN model regarding the trimethoprim-NMN and pyrimethamine-NMN drug-biomarker interactions, including the respective observed data [[1](#reference)][[2](#reference)]. The applied [trimethoprim](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Trimethoprim-Model) [[3](#reference)] and pyrimethamine [[4](#reference)] models have been published previously, the latter refined to apply it for transporter-mediated interactions. Next to transporter inhibition (modeled with interaction constants from literature), inhibition of NMN synthesis by trimethoprim and pyrimethamine was hypothesized in the models, improving drug-biomarker interaction predictions. For further details and documentation, please refer to [[5](#reference)].
